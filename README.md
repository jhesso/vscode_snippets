## cpp.json
Contains snippets for my default class declaration/definition
### Usage:
- To use, in .cpp files you can type class definition (or a part of it like "defi") and you should be able to tab complete the snippet as usual :D
- in .hpp file (or where ever you want to declare the class) type class declaration (or a part of it like "decl") and you should be able to use it
